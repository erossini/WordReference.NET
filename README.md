WordReference.NET
=================

WordReference.NET is a .NET wrapper for the WordReference API. You can query for translations using a source and target language, provided the API supports it.

Using .NET 4.5, this library allows you to make requests asynchronously with one simple call.

See the included SampleApp for a demonstration of how to use the translation feature.
